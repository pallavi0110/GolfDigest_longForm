                        Although Mora is accustomed to rising at ungodly hours&#8212;its 4:30 in the morning&#8212;he looks to be in need of a long nap. <em>&ldquo;Ya soy viejo,&rdquo;</em> he says in Spanish, with a smile. (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m old.&rdquo;)
                     </p>
                     <p>Inside, his wife and seven children are asleep; the other homes on the cul-de-sac are quiet.
                        He stifles a yawn and rubs his eyes. By now, the stocky 50-year-old has spent the better part of two decades mowing greens
                        and raking bunkers in what amounts to an endless race against players eager to start smacking golf balls at first light. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still strong,&rdquo;
                        he says, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m starting to slow down.&rdquo;
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        It&rsquo;s a short drive to Mountain View Country Club, just north of PGA West in the town of La Quinta. By the time he arrives the sky has turned a magnificent deep-sea blue,
                        backlighting the palm trees that line the club&rsquo;s entrance. Inside <em>el shop</em>, as he calls the maintenance-employee headquarters,
                        Mora takes a seat among a dozen co-workers and receives his assignment from the trim and tan superintendent.
                        This morning, like most mornings, Mora&rsquo;s cutting the greens. When the group disbands, he mounts a cart loaded with the tools of his trade&#8212;rake,
                        shovel, weed whacker and hoe&#8212;and heads past spacious ranch-style homes to arrive at the course. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the mountain view,&rdquo; he says, pointing to the
                        San Jacinto range to the west. From here, it can be hard to remember that the course resides in the desert:
                        The grass is dark green, a group of ducks floats by and a cool breeze rustles through the trees.
                     </p>
                     <p>Mora is one of three workers assigned to the greens: The first cuts the interior with a riding mower,
                        the second&#8212;Mora&#8212;trims the edges with a push mower, and the third changes the cups. Mora yanks the cord of his mower,
                        joining the chorus of machines buzzing across the course. With his shoulders hunched and head tilted slightly to the right, he walks the perimeter of the green three times,
                        returning with a thin layer of Bermuda grass that he dumps into the back of the cart.
                     </p>

                     Mora is now at the 12th hole, and the few golfers who have emerged to brave the heat will soon disappear. &ldquo;In the summer, no one&rsquo;s out after 11,&rdquo; he says, his face glistening under an Adidas cap. No one, of course, except the workers. Today is relatively mild, with a high of 102 degrees. Later in the week it will hit 114.
                  </p>
                  <p>After finishing the greens, Mora returns to the shop with the other workers for a refried-bean sandwich and several large glasses of water. During the brief break our conversation turns to art. Back in his 20s&#8212;before he decided to attempt a border crossing from Mexico, before he knew words like rough and fairway and bunker&#8212;Mora spent much of his free time painting. He eventually came to prefer landscapes and still lifes; in one yellowing photo, a young Mora stands in front of his artwork at an exhibition in Guadalajara. He doesn&rsquo;t have the energy or time for such pursuits now&#8212;besides the golf job, he works nights at McDonald&rsquo;s&#8212;but he dreams of someday returning to the canvas. <span class="mobify-class">&ldquo;In Mexico you don&rsquo;t have as many things,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but you do have more time.&rdquo; He wipes his face with a wet towel. &ldquo;There are costs to living here.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the closest I&rsquo;ll hear him come to complaining.</span> </p>

In the McDonald&rsquo;s kitchen it&rsquo;s &ldquo;hurry, hurry, hurry,&rdquo; he says, sometimes making it hard to even find time for a bathroom break.

                     <div class="GD_Longform_dropcase" style="margin-right:0;"><img src="images/GD_dropcase_T.png" alt="Latino"></div>here are an estimated 180,000 golf-course maintenance workers in the United States who wake each morning at dawn with the never-ending assignment of keeping courses in playing shape. It&rsquo;s a labor-intensive operation&#8212;nearly $6 out of every $10 needed to maintain a course goes to maintenance workers&#8212;with a typical course having about 12 employees. Among the workforce are mechanics, irrigators and pesticide applicators, but the bulk of the labor is performed by operators and landscapers. Operators are responsible for mowing the fairways and rough, and landscapers like Mora cut the greens, rake  bunkers, change cups, and generally make sure everything&#8212;trees, shrubs, flowers, paths&#8212;looks pristine.
                  </p>
                  <p>However, despite their critical role, jobs in these two categories average $10 to $11 an hour, or just more than $20,000 a year.  </p>

                     Heath care is a challenge, too. It&rsquo;s not known what percentage of maintenance workers are uninsured, but only about one-quarter of low-wage workers in the United States have insurance through their employers. Workers at Mountain View are offered a health-care package, but Mora doesn&rsquo;t participate, citing the deductions it would take from his paycheck. He can&rsquo;t recall the last time he has been to the doctor, and his children have been covered under his wife&rsquo;s plan. (She works at Walmart.)

                     Many of the nation&rsquo;s 15,619 golf courses couldn&rsquo;t operate without Latino immigrants. The Golf Course Superintendents Association of America (GCSAA) estimates that two-thirds of the maintenance workforce is Latino, with the largest presence in California, Texas and Florida (85 percent), followed by the Northwest (50 percent) and the Midwest/Mideast (10 to 20 percent). During the past 20 years, the Latino population has dispersed across the country, growing especially fast in the South.

                     Wages figure into the equation as well. &ldquo;It would cost us a fortune if we hired a whole American workforce,&rdquo; says Lance Rogers, superintendent at Colonia (N.J.) Country Club. &ldquo;Everyone I know, their workforce is all immigrant.&rdquo; American workers, he says, want at least $14 an hour, but as the membership of his club has dropped by half since the recession, he says the club can&rsquo;t afford to pay that rate. So he goes with a crew from El Salvador, most of whom earn $9 to $10 an hour, which he estimates saves the club $70,000 a year. &ldquo;Those guys are the best,&rdquo; Rogers says, echoing a sentiment shared by many superintendents. &ldquo;The day after Hurricane Irene hit they came out and worked through the night, no questions asked.&rdquo;

                           It&rsquo;s likely that a good number of the immigrants are undocumented. In the Cornell study, 10 percent of the
                           superintendents reported having lost workers to deportations in the previous three years. And McKeel says that
                           if all employers are forced to use E-Verify&#8212;a voluntary federal program designed to identify unauthorized
                           immigrants&#8212;there&rsquo;s the potential of losing a chunk of the existing workforce, which is one reason the GCSAA
                           is supporting an expanded guest-worker program. This isn&rsquo;t a topic that superintendents are eager to discuss,
                           but it&rsquo;s hardly surprising. Many low-wage workplaces, from the tomato fields of Florida to the kitchens of the
                           finest New York City restaurants, would have a hard time surviving

               in a hardscrabble neighborhood near downtown Guadalajara, a bustling metropolis in the state of
               Jalisco.

               with his grandfather. As a teenager he took up two pursuits: the guitar and boxing. &ldquo;Our neighborhood
               was known for its fighters,&rdquo; he says, and Mora&#8212;who woke up early each morning for long runs around
               the neighborhood&#8212;won several local tournaments. Along the way he picked up two tattoos, a spider web
               on his left hand and a bull on his left forearm. He did the work himself, with a large sewing needle.

               stories to tell and pockets full of cash. &ldquo;I told my dad that when I got back, we would use the money to open
               up a new shop,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It was going to be a quick trip.&rdquo; A wry smile crosses Mora&rsquo;s face. That was more than
               25 years ago.</p>

                     Crossing was easy; eluding capture was not. By Mora&rsquo;s count they were apprehended eight times, sometimes by the same border-patrol agents. One guard, recognizing Mora, told him to try crossing somewhere else. They took his advice and headed west to Tijuana. After being caught six more times&#8212;&ldquo;We were determined,&rdquo; he laughs&#8212;they charged down a hill on a starry night and finally made it safely into California. During a brief stopover in Los Angeles they spent $40 for fake green cards and Social Security numbers, then reunited with Maria Isabel&rsquo;s sister in Coachella.

                     The new arrivals harvested crops, cleaned buildings, washed dishes and built houses. Like Mora, they found their way onto golf courses. Soon after arriving in Coachella, he was employed as a landscaper at the Vintage Club, an exclusive development  with two 18-hole courses.

                     At Vintage, it didn&rsquo;t take long for Mora to realize a hard truth: Amid his dreams of higher wages, he&rsquo;d forgotten to factor in higher costs. He started at $6 an hour&#8212;much more than he&rsquo;d made at home&#8212;but expenses mounted quickly. &ldquo;I never was able to send much money home to my parents,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Rent, food, bills . . . &rdquo; His voice trails off. Then there was his growing family to support. Maria Isabel was three months&rsquo; pregnant when they crossed, and two more children soon followed. Meanwhile, cheap vinyl flooded Mexico&rsquo;s market, eating sharply into the demand for leather. Francisco&rsquo;s dream of returning home to open a new tannery shop with his father waned.

                  <p>
                     But Francisco and Maria Isabel made it work, like families do, and Mora found Vintage and its close-knit maintenance crew a good place. There was a volleyball court next to the shop, and in the cooler months the staff would play during breaks, preparing for an annual tournament against teams from other clubs. Mora took to the work with passion and discovered he was good at it. Soon he was earning raises and taking home an employee-of-the-month plaque. That he was an undocumented immigrant wasn&rsquo;t particularly important. He was paid like any other employee, by company check with taxes withheld. &ldquo;A lot of people didn&rsquo;t have real documents,&rdquo; Mora says. &ldquo;It was more relaxed then.&rdquo;

The Obama administration deported a record 1.5 million individuals during its first term, and on the local level a number of states have passed tougher laws in the hopes that unauthorized immigrants will pack up and leave. That trend began in 2010 with <span class="dialog-pointer dialog-SB1070 overlay" rel="#dialog1">Arizona&rsquo;s controversial SB1070</span>, which permitted police officers to check the immigration status of people they suspect are in the country illegally. Georgia passed a similar law the next year, which also punished workers who land jobs using fake IDs&#8212;like Mora&#8212;with up to 15 years in prison and $250,000 in fines. Elected officials in Alabama went further, including a provision, later ruled unconstitutional, that forced schools to collect immigration data on students.
                  </p>
                  <span class="lang_desc">The language could get ugly. A co-sponsor of the Alabama bill said it was time to &lsquo;empty the clip and do what has to be done.&rsquo; Another Alabama politician said he would do anything &lsquo;short of shooting&rsquo; undocumented immigrants.</span>
                  <p>As the overheated rhetoric illustrates, the immigration issue cuts deep for many Americans, and people on opposite sides can draw very different conclusions about an individual like Mora. Those supporting a crackdown will say he crossed the border illegally, received a job that might have gone to an American citizen, and failed to file taxes for many years. Others will argue that Mora is a devoted family man who fills a labor gap&#8212;who wants to work in temperatures that exceed 110 degrees?&#8212;and that payroll taxes were in fact deducted from his paycheck. He also paid sales, property and income taxes and helped subsidize Social Security. (Undocumented immigrants who use fake numbers pay into a system from which they&rsquo;ll never collect.) There are plenty of studies both sides can point to, which have found that undocumented immigrants have a slightly positive or negative effect on wages and jobs. </p>
                  <p>More recently, however, a growing number of Americans have come to support legalizing the county&rsquo;s 11 million unauthorized immigrants. </p>

                     The survey also found that a majority believed that newcomers strengthen society rather than threaten traditional American values. Such sentiments could help the current push for immigration reform. In June, the Senate passed a bill that would put undocumented immigrants on a 13-year path to citizenship. If enacted, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would save $175 billion during the first decade, partly because of additional taxes paid by newly legalized immigrants, and boost the GDP by 3.3 percent. But the measure faces stiff resistance in the House, where a number of conservative members have declared it &ldquo;dead on arrival.&rdquo; Instead, they plan to focus on increased border security.

            <p>SB1070 was signed into law by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer in 2010. The law grants local police officers the power to check the immigration status of people they detain; makes it a crime for undocumented immigrants to apply for or hold a job; and penalizes immigrants who fail to carry their immigration papers. In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that much of the bill was unconstitutional, though it allowed the &quot;show me the papers&quot; provision, which grants police the right check the immigration status of people they detain.

            <p>A survey by the Pew Research Center in the spring of 2013 found that 71 percent of Americans believe that undocumented immigrants should be allowed to remain in this country if they meet certain requirements. Of those who favor allowing such immigrants to stay, 43 percent believe they should be allowed to become citizens, and 24 percent believe they should become legal residents. The survey highlighted American&sbquo;s warming feelings about immigrants, with only 41 percent of respondents saying that they thought immigrants were a burden, down from 50 percent in a 2010 survey.

                        is part of a second wave that&rsquo;s increasingly headed to the southern part of the United States.
                        It&rsquo;s an overcast day when we meet at a public course in an Atlanta suburb, and Oscar, 70,
                        spends much of his shift pumping water out of bunkers, the result of a recent storm.
                        Oscar, who resembles an older Tom Selleck, is initially hesitant to speak and agrees to an
                        interview only after I assure him that I&rsquo;m not an undercover immigration agent. (I also agree to
                        change his name and not identify his workplace.)
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Oscar is from the Mexican state of Tamaulipas and followed his son to Georgia
                        in the 1990s. Before the journey, Oscar had been working at a ranch, struggling to
                        support his wife while earning 200 pesos a week, or about $70 then. After moving into a
                        room at his son&rsquo;s house in Marietta, a town 20 miles north of Atlanta, he got in touch with a
                        friend from his hometown. &ldquo;He said he was working at something called a golf course,&rdquo; says Oscar,
                        who had never heard of the sport. But he tagged along one morning, and when the crew began pulling weeds,
                        Oscar took out his pocketknife and uprooted a few. The superintendent came by, noticed the new face, and
                        told him to show up the next day. <span class="mobify-class">Pay was modest&#8212;$5 an hour&#8212;but he would be making more in two days than

            Oscar learned the work quickly and took up the game, playing weekly in his younger years. &ldquo;My clubs were all different brands at first, and I thought that the bigger the number, the farther the ball would go,&rdquo; he says, chuckling. Like Mora, he takes the work seriously. &ldquo;<i>Quiero todo perfecto,</i>&rdquo; he says, locking eyes to make sure I understand the importance of a perfect course.

                     <div> Oscar can be tough on others, too. One morning on the course, someone compliments his co-worker, who is mowing a green. Oscar pauses from blowing leaves and takes a long look. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But you have to watch him. Sometimes he cuts lines that look like bananas.&rdquo;  </div>
                     <p>
                        Oscar has worked on four courses and says when he first arrived, the workforce was diverse&#8212;black, white, Latino&#8212;but now it&rsquo;s all Latino immigrants. Over the years he has mentored a stream of younger workers but believes many didn&rsquo;t display sufficient commitment. When he needs to cut shrubs or branches in a hurry, he takes to the course with a machete and lets loose. One time, after a rare snowfall, a superintendent told Oscar to cut the greens. He obeyed despite reservations, and slid his riding mower into the water, going in up to his chest. &ldquo;You have to be willing to do whatever needs to be done and follow all directions,&rdquo; he says.
                     </p>
                     <p>Oscar now makes nearly $11 an hour and is able to send $350 home each month to his wife, who has diabetes. His remittances have also turned what was once their small wood shack into a large cement house. &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s Day is coming,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and so I&rsquo;ll send something extra to make sure she can pass the day pleasantly.&rdquo; </p>
                     <p>  But after an hour of sunny news&#8212;work he cares about, a new house in Mexico, the sizable sum he dedicates to his wife&#8212;Oscar starts sobbing when asked about the last time he has been home.  </p>

                     <p>
                        In the last photo he received she looked sickly, gaunt in the face. He feels stuck, unsure of what to do. &ldquo;If I go back, how will I make money to take care of her?&rdquo;
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Adding to his stress is a new state law that cracks down on undocumented immigrants. Faced with an influx of newcomers&#8212;Georgia&rsquo;s Latino population has grown by an astounding 784 percent since 1990&#8212;<span class="dialog-pointer dialog-HB87 overlay" rel="#dialog2">lawmakers passed HB 87 in 2011</span>. Modeled after Arizona&rsquo;s law, the bill gives local police the power to check the immigration papers of people they stop. Now Oscar feels as if he&rsquo;s on house arrest and rarely ventures from his rented room except to go to work and buy groceries. His granddaughter, a U.S. citizen by birth, has noted the change and asks him why he doesn&rsquo;t visit his friends anymore.

                        He can log up to 70 hours of work each week, and his home phone
                        has been cut off because he couldn&rsquo;t afford to pay the bill. When he
                        does get a day off, he tries to spend it with his children. On a recent
                        Sunday afternoon he&rsquo;s sitting on a plastic chair in his front yard watching
                        his 11-year-old daughter, Angie, ride her bike.

                     <p>
                        Suddenly Angie, who had disappeared into the cul-de-sac,
                        comes careening down the street at full speed, shrieking with joy.

                        &ldquo;Angie, be careful!&rdquo; Mora shouts, moments before she takes a sideways spill over the curb.
                        She stands up, dusts off her yellow dress and runs laughing into her father&rsquo;s arms.
                        He rubs her head and tells her to slow down. &ldquo;She never stops moving,&rdquo; he says.
                        &ldquo;You have to watch her, or she&rsquo;ll just disappear down the street.&rdquo;

                        &ldquo;I want to give my kids a chance,&rdquo; he says as Angie heads back to her bike.
                        Having left the third grade for a lifetime of hard work, he envisions his kids sitting
                        inside air-conditioned offices, typing away behind computers, doing the kinds of jobs

                           going over math problems. And, of course, hanging out, like what he&rsquo;s doing now, watching her bike along the street and fruitlessly encouraging her to slow down.

                  He spent two years collecting unemployment.
                  The only bright spot was that Maria Isabel managed to keep her job at Walmart,
                  where she works in the bakery. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the one making the real money in the family now,&rdquo; Mora says.

                  His break came in early 2010, just as his benefits were ending.
                  A caseworker told him about an opening at Mountain View. He rushed over
                  and filled out an application. Considering the state of the economy, he feels
                  fortunate to have a job. But like many victims of the recession, he has ground to make up.
                  At Mountain View he was hired at $8.50 an hour&#8212;his pay has since risen to $8.84&#8212;and he knew
                  he would need a second job to make ends meet. One day, while eating at McDonald&rsquo;s,
                  he noticed a help-wanted sign. Now Mora often takes a shower in Mountain View&rsquo;s
                  maintenance shop after a shift and drives straight to McDonald&rsquo;s, and it&rsquo;s not
                  uncommon for several days to pass before he sees his children or wife awake.
                  <span class="mobify-class">Mora puts in nearly 40 hours at the course each week and another 25 to 30 at McDonald&rsquo;s.
                  Fortunately, his daughter April, 24, lives at home and watches Angie and her brother David,
                  5. &ldquo;My dad was the one who used to take us everywhere,&rdquo; April says.
                  &ldquo;We went to church, to the park, to the pool. He was so playful, and
                  protective of us girls. My mom says, &lsquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for your dad, you&rsquo;d
                  be all over the place.&rsquo; Now it&rsquo;s different because he&rsquo;s always working.&rdquo;</span>
               </p>
               <p>
                  Still, Mora thinks the long hours away help clarify his priorities.
                  He hates to miss big events&#8212;like the party he couldn&rsquo;t attend for his 22-year-old son,
                  Steven, who recently graduated from junior college&#8212;and sometimes it can feel like life
                  is passing him by. So he tries to slow down when he&rsquo;s home.

                        mowing the lawn next to Mountain View&rsquo;s clubhouse. His normally
                        gentle face tenses as he maneuvers the machine in tight arcs around trees,
                        ducking his head to avoid low-hanging branches. It&rsquo;s only 10 o&rsquo;clock in the morning,
                        but the heat has already driven everyone from the course except for an intrepid group
                        of women who are determined to finish their round. By now Mora has replaced his Adidas
                        cap with a straw hat and draped a wet towel over his head.

                        During a break, he tells me he has been thinking about the future.
                        One of the challenges with Angie, he says, has been communicating with her
                        therapists and caseworkers. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t speak Spanish, and sometimes we don&rsquo;t
                        know what they are trying to tell us. As a parent, it can be hard to not know what
                        to do.&rdquo; So Mora has begun contemplating a new career. He might enroll in English
                        classes, get his GED, and take courses to get a job working with immigrant parents
                        who have disabled kids. &ldquo;That would be really important,&rdquo; he says.
                     </p>
                        </div>
                  </div>
                  <div class="sec10desc">

                        It&rsquo;s a challenge, for sure. How many 50-year-olds reinvent
                        themselves&#8212;much less ones who left school after the third grade and don&rsquo;t
                        have a firm command of English? He admits it would be difficult, but the man
                        who was caught more than a dozen times before finally arriving in the United
                        States shrugs it off. Everything is a challenge.

                        For now it&rsquo;s just his private dream. In waking life,
                        Mora finishes up the grass, eats a lunch of fish tacos under the
                        shade of a palm tree and spends the rest of his shift at Mountain
                        View weeding flower beds on his knees. When he gets home, Angie is inside,
                        wearing a striped purple shirt with the word LOVE emblazoned across the chest.
                        She charges at her father with a hug. But time is, of course, short. <span class="mobify-class">He takes a
                        quick shower and heads out the door to McDonald&rsquo;s. When he arrives, the drive-thru
                        lane is backed up, and half a dozen customers are waiting inside on their orders.
                        &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go! Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; yells a supervisor wearing a headset, at no one in particular.
                        As she paces behind the registers, Mora slips on his black McDonald&rsquo;s cap,
                        clocks in, and disappears into the kitchen.</span>
